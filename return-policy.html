        <!-- General Return Policy for All Items -->
        <h4>General Policy:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>All items returned must be in sellable condition.</li>
            <li>Items should be returned in a reasonably sized box. Larger boxes with more products have a higher
                probability of arriving damaged.
                <ul>
                    <li>If your store needs more than one return label, please fill out the return portal more than
                        once.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Returns should be packed with adequate packing material to ensure the product does not shift around and
                therefore get damaged in its journey to our return facility.
                <ul>
                    <li>Any damaged products due to improper packaging will be billed to your store.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>All like items should be bundled together to minimize the risk of damage during transit.
                <ul>
                    <li>(Ex. Pokémon cards should be bundled together with rubber bands to prevent individual card packs
                        from sliding around the box.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>All product returned should be free of price tags.
                <ul>
                    <li>Any price tag placed on product needs to be removed prior to sending back your return.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Any items returned should be free from stains.</li>
            <li>Ensure any items returned are items that were sent by All Sports Marketing. Any items that do not belong
                to us will not be sent back unless your store is willing to pay for return shipping.
                <ul>
                    <li>If we receive items that do not belong to us, your store will be notified by someone from All
                        Sports.
                    </li>
                    <li>Items that do not belong to us will be held for 90 days. If we do not hear from you by then, we
                        will assume you no longer want the items and they will become property of All Sports Marketing,
                        Inc.

                <ul>
                    <li>When sending these items back, they all NEED to be individually bagged in their original plastic
                        bags or in individual grocery bags. Without protection, these items WILL arrive damaged and
                        scuffed, no matter how neatly they are packed, rendering them unsellable.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>All cards need to arrive bundled together by release in a new, unopened state. Please try not to
                        exceed 12 cards per bundle to prevent warping/bending of the packs.
                    </li>
                    <li>(Ex. Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield—Rebel Clash should be bundled separate from Pokémon Sword &amp;

                    </li>
                    <li>Crushed, torn, or otherwise damaged Funkos due to improper packing/packaging will be billed to

                        their original packaging material as well as hanging tags.
